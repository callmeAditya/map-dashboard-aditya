# Building a Map Dashboard to Visualize Geographical Data  
The given project visualizes geographical data based on user input points in the form of latitude and longitude and constructs a polygonal figure of the required area using MapBoxjs library using the Reactjs framework. The given application is a single-page web application styled by MUI theme library for rapid development and visually appealing UI. 


## Getting Started 

Simply run 'npm start' without quotes to run the application. It runs via live-server and opens on localhost

## Project Requirements
- Before initialization, the project scope is analyzed and items are gathered for efficient development. The points required to construct a polygon are downloaded and the state of the objects is defined at the beginning of the project.

## Project Development
- The project is developed on React v16 and styled using the latest MUI library for a visually striking appearance. The project is developed using functional-based components and hooks to map changes in states.
- Slider and Select components are integrated to give a rich user interface.
- Finally, a drawer component is integrated to hide cluttered data and give a whole picture to application.

## Project Testing
- The project is tested based on the different combinations of select values and the slider is tested for optimum results. Eg: When visibility is hidden, the slider intensity should get disabled.

## Project Deployment
- The project is deployed on GitHub and hosted on https://github.com/callmeAditya/map-dashboard-aditya for efficient review and easier access to the project.
- The project is directly developed on the main branch.
